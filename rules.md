title: Net Quorum Protocol
description: method for collective decision making online
---

# Overview

This Net Quorum Protocol allows an online group to make collective decisions over time, even as members come and go.

These rules set up a bicameral structure.  Special members act as the upper house.  Becoming a special members requires the approval of existing special members.  Regular members act as the lower house.  Anyone who meets the group's requirements for regular membership can become a regular member.

Any member can take a vote.  Voting requires reaching out to members using their contact information, collecting their responses, and most importantly, documenting the process so other members can verify the result.
